Stochastic Gradient Descent for Graph Drawing [<https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04626>]

The main code used for timing experiments in the paper is in C#, run as a command line application that takes paths as command line arguments: input .txt file, output stress trajectory, output .svg layout.

The graph data used comes from <https://sparse.tamu.edu>, downloaded in .mat format. A matlab script is provided in the same folder to convert it into the unweighted .txt format that the C# code uses. If a graph has disconnected subgraphs, it will select the largest weakly connected component.

A Jupyter notebook is also provided, which is rather slow, but serves as a good introduction to the algorithm. It can even be rendered directly in GitHub, showing the output for the graph `qh882`, as well as `commanche_dual` in an implementation of the Sparse Stress Model of Ortmann et al. [<https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08909>].

A fast Python version is also available, implemented in C++ using SWIG to generate bindings. It may be installed using
```
pip install s_gd2
```
and an example use case looks like
```python
import s_gd2
import networkx as nx
G = nx.balanced_tree(2,9)
S = nx.to_scipy_sparse_matrix(G)
X = s_gd2.layout_scipy(S)
nx.draw(G, pos=X)
```
